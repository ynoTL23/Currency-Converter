# TTP Day 6 DOM Challenge

The challenge for day 6 of the TTP Winter bootcamp carries the same goal as previous days. The assignment will be used to further existing understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, DOM manipulation and user event handling. In addition, the challenge will help introduce and learn two new concepts: Promises and fetch API.

The challenge produces a basic currency converter using an API.  
The API used is provided by: https://www.exchangerate-api.com/

The final page will include features such as:
- A dropdown that contains currencies from different countries to convert from
- An input box where the user will enter the amount that he/she would like to convert to the new currency 
- A dropdown that contains currency to convert to
- A read-only input box where the results of converted currencies will be posted
- A Button: when clicked will be used to convert the currency. If the user clicks this button and the input box where the user is supposed to enter the currency is empty, then the user should be alerted that they should provide some form of valid input.
